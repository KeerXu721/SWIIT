# SWiT: Emoji Annotation

**Authors:** Emily Braun, Joyce Guo, Kasey La, Keer Xu

This is our semester group project for Natural Language Annotation for Machine Learning (COSI 230b) where students 
have the opportunity to apply natural language annotation skills learned throughout the semester. After forming groups,
our tasks are to create a dataset, perform pre-processing on the collected dataset, write and revise annotation
guidelines following the MAMA (Model-Annotate-Model-Annotate) cycle, retrieve annotated data from internal and external
annotation, report inter-annotator agreement, train a model on our annotated dataset, and write a paper and present
the process of the project throughout the semester.

This folder contains 8 files:

1. This **README** file.
2. **Scripts**, a folder containing .py scripts used to create the files for this project.
3. **old_data**, a folder containing old data used for internal annotation.
4. **original_data**, a folder containing the original datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericwang1011/tweets-with-emoji).
5. **processed_data**, a folder containing the pre-processed dataset, where the data is presented in .csv format and in folders of .txt files.
6. **Annotation guidelines v2.pdf**, a document outlining our goals, the classification task, and the annotation guidelines for our task.
7. **SWiT Emoji Sentiment Brat Setup & Tutorial (External).pdf**, a document containing the instructions for setup and annotating in BRAT.
8. **swit_files.zip**, a zipped folder containing data and configuration files to be annotated and opened in BRAT.
